## Simple Chatbot

This is a basic implementation of a chatbot in Python. The chatbot responds to user inputs with predefined patterns and provides corresponding responses.
Features
* Greetings: The chatbot responds to common greetings like "hi" and "hello."
* Personal Information: It shares information about its nature, such as not having a name and being from the digital world.
* Interests and Hobbies: The chatbot talks about its 'interest' in chatting with users and its lack of personal preferences like favorite colors.
* Farewell: It gracefully says goodbye when the user inputs "bye."
* Jokes and Fun Facts: The chatbot can tell jokes and share interesting facts.
* 
Usage
* 		Run the script in a Python environment.
* 		Enter your messages when prompted.
* 		The chatbot will respond based on predefined patterns.
Adding More Patterns
Feel free to extend the chatbot's capabilities by adding more patterns and responses. Simply edit the data dictionary in the code to include additional patterns and their corresponding responses.

Examples
* User: "What's your favorite color?"
    * Chatbot: "I'm a chatbot, so I don't have personal preferences for colors."
* User: "Tell me a joke."
    * Chatbot: "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"
* User: "What is artificial intelligence?"
    * Chatbot: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans."

 This dictionary data contains predefined patterns as keys and corresponding responses as values. Each key represents a user input pattern, and the associated value is the response the chatbot will provide.
 
## get_response Function:

``` bash
	def get_response(user_input):
    for pattern, response in data.items():
        if pattern in user_input:
            return response
    return "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you please rephrase your sentence?"
```
  
â€¨â€¨The get_response function iterates through the data dictionary and checks if any patterns match the user input. If a match is found, it returns the corresponding response. If no match is found, it returns a default response indicating that it didn't understand the input.

## Main Program:
   
```bash
print("Chatbot: Hi! I'm a simple chatbot, I'm here to assist you!")

while True:
    user_input = input("Me: ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'bye':
        print("Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!")
        break
    response = get_response(user_input)
    print("Chatbot:", response)
```    

The main program initializes the chatbot with a greeting. It then enters a loop where it continuously takes user input, processes it using the get_response function, and prints the chatbot's response. The loop continues until the user inputs "bye," at which point the chatbot says goodbye and the program exits.â€¨â€¨

## Continuous Expansion:
To enhance the chatbot, you can continue adding more patterns and responses to the data dictionary. For example, you can add patterns related to technical topics, specific queries, or any other interactions you want the chatbot to handle.
